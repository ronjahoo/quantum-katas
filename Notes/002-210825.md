# Continuing on Complex Arithmetic

- I did 2 more exercises from the Complex Arithmetic tutorial

## My codes so far

Exercise 1
```python
@exercise
def imaginary_power(n : int) -> int:
    # If n is divisible by 4
    if n % 4 == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return -1
```

Exercise 2
```python
@exercise
def complex_add(x : Complex, y : Complex) -> Complex:
    # You can extract elements from a tuple like this
    a = x[0]
    b = x[1]
    
    c = y[0]
    d = y[1]
    
    # This creates a new variable and stores the real component into it
    real = a + c
    # Replace the ... with code to calculate the imaginary component
    imaginary = b + d
    
    # You can create a tuple like this
    ans = (real, imaginary)
    
    return ans
```

Exercise 3
```python
@exercise
def complex_mult(x : Complex, y : Complex) -> Complex:
    a = x[0]
    b = x[1]
    c = y[0]
    d = y[1]

    real = a*c - b*d
    imaginary = a*d + b*c

    ans = (real, imaginary)

    return ans
```
