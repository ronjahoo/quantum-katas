# Continued Complex Arithmetic

Exercise 4
```
@exercise
def conjugate(x : Complex) -> Complex:
    return (x[0], -x[1])
```

Exercise 5
- it took me a while to understand that the given formula of ((a+bi)(c-di))/(c^2d^2) needs to be extended to have real and imaginary parts different from each other...

```
@exercise
def complex_div(x : Complex, y : Complex) -> Complex:
    lower = y[0] ** 2 + y[1] ** 2
    real = x[0] * y[0] + x[1] * y[1]
    imaginary = -x[0] * y[1] + x[1] * y[0]
    return (real / lower, imaginary / lower)
```
