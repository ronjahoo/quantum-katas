# 🌌 Quantum Katas — My Solutions

This repository contains **my personal solutions** to the [Microsoft Quantum Katas](https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumKatas). The original Katas (tasks, tests, and supporting code) are created and licensed by Microsoft under the MIT License.  

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: Only the solutions (`Tasks.qs` modifications, jupyter notebook cell changes, notes in `Notes/`, and additional comments) are my own work (check GitHub history). The problem statements, test harnesses, and original project structure are from Microsoft.
