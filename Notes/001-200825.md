# The first day of this project

- I got the setup working and started on the Complex Arithmetic tutorial notebook
    - I forked Microsoft's repository and cloned my fork of the project to my pc
    - I installed .NET 6.0 since it was expected in global.json
    - I needed to remove an obsolete NuGet but then dotnet restore worked and so dotnet test
    - I then installed IQ# kernel (had a bit of problems with it but it worked out)
    - I created environment in Python and ran the jupyter notebook cells
    - I did the first small tutorial exercise and called it a day
    - Lastly, I updated the README and pushed my changes from today
